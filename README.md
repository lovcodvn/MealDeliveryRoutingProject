# MealDeliveryRoutingProject

According to Statista reports, revenue in the Meal Delivery Segment is projected to reach US$660.10m in 2023 and is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2023-2027) of 4.87%, resulting in a projected market volume of US$798.30m by 2027 in Singapore.

This rapid growth of the meal delivery industry has resulted in an increasing demand for efficient routing algorithms that can effectively manage the dynamic and complex nature of the delivery process. The unique challenges in meal delivery systems include, but not limited to, fluctuating customer orders, time-sensitive delivery windows, and varying traffic conditions. Hence, the need for an optimized routing strategy has become crucial to ensure customer satisfaction, minimize delivery times, and reduce operational costs.

This project presents the Meal Delivery Routing Problem (MDRP) and a rolling-horizon algorithm that offers a solution to the MDRP. The algorithm leverages the research on MDRP by Damien Reyes et.al (2018) as well as advances in the field of dynamic and stochastic optimization. This report aims to contribute to the body of knowledge on MDRP by discussing the development, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed algorithm.
